Here's what I can tell you about our pricing and offerings:
Delve's pricing structure includes renewal pricing that remains the same year over year unless the company crosses specific employee thresholds (15, 30, or 45 employees). Additionally, penetration testing is included in SOC 2 and ISO 27001 contracts, with advanced tests starting at $4,500. Importantly, there are no hidden costs; once you sign with Delve, you do not pay anything else until you receive your signed report.
CONFIDENCE: 0.9
For detailed pricing specific to your organization size and needs, I can also connect you with our sales team for a personalized quote.

AI Security Questionnaires: Delve's platform can autofill vendor questionnaires with answers that are trained on the organization's compliance setup, saving time and reducing errors.
AI Code Scanning: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is embedded in Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to identify compliance issues before they reach production.
AI Infrastructure Scanning: The platform scans cloud environments for misconfigurations and provides real-time alerts to mitigate risks.
AI Policy Assistant: Users can receive instant answers regarding compliance policies, enhancing understanding and adherence.
