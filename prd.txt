   - 24/7 monitoring expectations
   - High-pressure, real-time support environment

3. **Knowledge Management Chaos**
   - Manual knowledge base maintenance
   - Recurring issues not systematically addressed
   - Support engineers writing docs while firefighting

4. **Compliance/GRC Complexity**
   - Technical compliance questions require deep expertise
   - Audit support during critical moments
   - Security review guidance needed immediately

5. **Escalation Inefficiency**
   - No systematic triage process
   - Engineering team interrupted constantly
   - Context loss during handoffs
