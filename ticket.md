Ticket Handling + Slack Escalation
This is critical. Hereâ€™s how to avoid chaos when multiple tickets come in:

Slack Workflow
One Slack Channel for all tickets: #support-escalations.

Each new conversation â†’ new Slack thread.

Use Accept button in Slack thread to claim ownership:

When clicked:

Lock conversation to that agent (store in DB or memory state).

Reply button â†’ sends owner response back to user via bot.

Once resolved:

Owner clicks Close Ticket button â†’ thread locked â†’ state cleared.

State Management
Each conversation = session_id (UUID).

Store in DB or Redis:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "user_id": "U12345",
  "state": "active",
  "assigned_to": "agent_slack_id",
  "history": [ ... ],
  "escalated": true
}
When new user message arrives, check:

If session_id exists â†’ append message.

If session closed â†’ start new thread.

âœ… Escalation Flow (End-to-End)
Bot fails to answer OR user asks for human â†’ confidence < threshold OR intent=escalation.

Bot posts to Slack channel:

From: User X
Question: "How does Delve handle vulnerability scanning?"
Summary: User wants info on vulnerability scanning.
Actions: [Accept Ticket] [Reply]
When Accept Ticket clicked:

Assign agent â†’ Lock thread.

Agent types in Slack â†’ message sent via webhook â†’ user gets reply from bot.

When done â†’ click Close Ticket â†’ archive conversation, free up session_id.

âœ… 4. Managing End of Conversation
Accept button solves multi-ticket chaos because:

No agent accidentally replies to wrong thread.

Bot only forwards Slack replies to the active assigned session.

Close Ticket resets session state and removes human escalation context.
