What is SOC 2 and why might I need it?
Avatar for Delve LangGraph Workflow Tester
SOC 2, or Service Organization Control 2, is a compliance framework designed for service providers that handle customer data. It focuses on five trust service criteria: Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy. Organizations may need SOC 2 compliance to demonstrate their commitment to data security and to build trust with customers, especially in industries where data protection is critical.
The SOC 2 compliance process typically involves a timeline of 30 minutes for onboarding, followed by 10-15 hours for platform setup, and an audit completion that can take 1-3 weeks. The observation period for a Type 2 audit is usually around 3 months, with the final audit taking 1-3 weeks. Delve's approach allows customers to complete SOC 2 implementation in as little as 4-7 days, significantly faster than traditional methods which can take over 150 hours.
Delve offers a comprehensive service that includes white-glove onboarding, 1:1 expert support, pre-vetted auditors, and a free Trust Report, ensuring a high success rate‚Äî100% of Delve customers pass their SOC 2 audit.

How do I request deletion of my data?
Avatar for Delve LangGraph Workflow Tester
Here's what I can tell you about our pricing and offerings:
To request deletion of your data under GDPR, you should exercise your rights as a data subject, specifically under Articles 12-22, which include the right to erasure (also known as the "right to be forgotten"). You can typically do this by contacting the data controller (the organization that holds your data) and formally requesting the deletion. Ensure you provide any necessary identification or information that may help them process your request.
If you need assistance with this process or have specific questions about how Delve handles data deletion requests, I recommend reaching out to our support team for the most accurate information.
