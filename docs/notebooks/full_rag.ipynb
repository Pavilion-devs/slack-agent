This role gives the President significant authority over military operations and decisions, although they do not have the power to declare war, which is reserved for Congress.\n",
      "The President has the power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment. This means the President can forgive or lessen the punishment for federal crimes, but this power does not extend to impeachments.\n",
      "In the context of the United States Constitution, \"impeachment\" refers to the process by which a sitting government official, including the President, can be charged with misconduct. The House of Representatives has the sole power to impeach, which means to formally accuse an official of wrongdoing. Once the House impeaches an official, the Senate then holds a trial to determine whether to convict and remove the official from office.\n",

The judgment in cases of impeachment can only result in removal from office and disqualification from holding further office, but the official may still be subject to legal indictment and punishment separate from the impeachment process itself.\n",
      "The president of the United States can be elected to the office no more than twice. This means a president can serve two four-year terms. If someone has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected, they can only be elected to the presidency once more.\n",
      "The context provided does not contain information about the term length for U.S. Senators. However, I can inform you that according to the U.S. Constitution, a U.S. Senator serves a term of six years. There are no limits on the number of terms a Senator may serve, allowing them to be re-elected indefinitely.\n"
