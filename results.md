⚠️  Escalation needed: Low confidence score (0.40) below threshold (0.65)

💬 RESPONSE:
To configure SSO (Single Sign-On), you would need to follow these general steps:

1. Choose an identity provider (IdP) that supports SSO protocols such as OAuth, OpenID Connect, or RADIUS.
2. Configure the IdP with your organization's authentication system, including user credentials and permissions.
3. Integrate the chosen SSO protocol with your application or service using APIs or SDKs provided by the IdP.
4. Implement authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) or passwordless authentication, to enhance security.

However, without more specific information on how Delve's platform integrates with SSO protocols or its exact implementation details, I can only provide a general outline of the steps involved in configuring SSO.

To implement GDPR data rights, Delve's compliance platform can help with:

1. Data mapping activities: Identify and document all personal data processed by your organization.
2. Legal basis assessments: Determine the legal basis for processing personal data, including consent and legitimate interest.
3. Privacy policy updates: Create a comprehensive privacy policy that outlines your organization's data protection practices.
4. Consent management mechanisms: Implement mechanisms to obtain and manage consent from data subjects.

Delve's platform can also help with GDPR key requirements, such as:

* Data subject rights (Articles 12-22)
* Controller obligations (data protection by design and breach notification requirements)
* Legal basis determination (consent vs. legitimate interest assessments)

To implement these requirements, Delve's expert compliance AI assistant can provide guidance on data mapping activities, legal basis assessments, privacy policy updates, consent management mechanisms, and more.

   Frameworks Detected: ISO27001

💬 RESPONSE:
Answer: An Information Security Management System (ISMS) is a systematic approach to managing and protecting an organization's information assets. It involves implementing policies, procedures, and controls to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.

An ISMS typically includes various components such as security management processes, workforce security, information access management, security awareness training, incident response, contingency planning, facility access controls, workstation use policies, workstation security, device/media control, access controls with user identification, audit controls, integrity protections, person/entity authentication, and transmission security with end-to-end encryption.

ISMS is often used in conjunction with other compliance frameworks such as SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR, and ISO 27001 to ensure that an organization's information assets are properly protected and managed.
